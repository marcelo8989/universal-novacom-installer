Users of WebOS Quick Install have noticed the Novacom driver installation system was completely renovated with WOSQI v4.04.

Inspired by PuffTheMagic's novacom driver app, I've decided to take my novacom driver installation code and put it in a standalone app.

It supports Windows (32bit and 64bit), Mac OS, and Ubuntu (32bit and 64bit)
